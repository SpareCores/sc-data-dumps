  "description": "Serving smaller (1-65 kB) and larger (256-512 kB) files using a static HTTP server (binserve), and benchmarking each workload (wrk) using variable number of threads (and keeping the threads with the maximum performance) and connections (recorded after divided by the number of vCPUs to make it comparable with other servers with different vCPU count) on the same server. Extrapolated throughput is calculated by multiplying the exrapolated RPS with the served file size. The extrapolated RPS is based on the measured RPS adjusted by the server's and client's time spent executing in user/system mode, so trying to control for the client resource usage.",
