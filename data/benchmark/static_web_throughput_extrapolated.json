  "description": "Serving smaller (1-65 kb) and larger (256-512 kb) files using a static HTTP server (binserve), and benchmarking each workload (wrk) using variable number of threads and connections on the same server. Exrapolated throughput is calculated by multiplying the exrapolated RPS with the served file size. The extrapolated RPS is based on the measured RPS adjusted by the server's and client's time spent executing in user/system mode, so trying to control for the client resource usage.",
