  "description": "Running a pair of redis server and benchmarking client (memtier_benchmark) on each vCPU to evaluate the performance of SET operations, using different number of concurrent pipelined requests. The measured RPS (ops/sec) is the sum of RPS measured in all parallel processes, but is not the maximum expected redis server speed, as the server(s) shared CPU with the client(s).",
