  "description": "Serving smaller (1-65 kb) and larger (256-512 kb) files using a static HTTP server (binserve), and benchmarking each workload (wrk) using variable number of threads and connections on the same server. Throughput is calculated by multiplying the RPS with the served file size. The measured RPS is not the maximum expected server speed, as the server shared CPU with the client.",
